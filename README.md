# SpacesApps 2021 - Mapping Space Trash in Real Time

This git repository corresponds to the code written for the *Mapping Space Trash in Real Time* challenge during the *SpaceApps 2021* competition by team ***JAIA***.

The two main programming languages used were **Python** and **JavaScript**. The Python part of the program is in charge of generating .txt files with the information corresponding to the position of the debris, which was recovered from **Celestrak** using the *Skyfield API*. In the other hand, the JavaScript program is in charge of mapping the globe and the debris according to the data given by Celestrak, which is done using **NASA WorldWind**.
